## Introduction
In today's world, time plays a very important factor in every feild. One such important feild is calculation. A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers at a very fast rate. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponential operations, roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions. In this mini-project, i will be designing a calculator which can perform operations like **addition**, **substraction**, **multiplication**, **division**, **factorial**, **simple logarithmic functions**, **simple trigonometry** and **permutation and combination**. 

## Cost and Features and Timeline
Calculator is a cheap device which can cost upto an amount of Two thousand Rupees for those which offer various functions like solving vectors and matrices. Simple calculators cost a few hundred rupees.

A calculator can have various features. Some of them provide different modes for calculation. It can operate with complex numbers, convert a number from one number system to the other, give the output in scientific notation terms and many others.

Nowadays, calculators come in mobile phones, tablets, laptops and many other devices. It also comes as a device which is exclusively used for calculating. Calculators will naver go out of use as time goes on. There will be various requirements of calculators whenever we need to analyse something and comeup with exact output.
Reguarding the cost of calculators, the price will go higher as new operations and features are included in it as time goes and new calculations come into play

## Defining Our System
Our system, ie calculator consists of a terminal that takes user inputs and commands accordingly. It then passes the data to another unit which calculates the user inputs according to the given commands. The results are then displayed on the calculator screen.
